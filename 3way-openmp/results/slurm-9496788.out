61: the '''aar type a switcher truck''' is a [[diesel locomotive]] [[bogie|truck]] introduced by [[electro-motive diesel|emd]] and installed as standard equipment on most emd [[switcher]] locomotives and on those of other manufacturers. it was designed by [[martin p blomberg]] and its us patent was filed on jul 6, 1937 and approved nov 15, 1938 under {{us patent|2,137,074}}. it was designed for switcher service where the more complex high-speed passenger locomotive trucks were not needed. the truck uses drop equalizers but does not have swing hangers as used on the [[blomberg b]] and others. a combination of [[coil spring]]s, and [[leaf springs]], positioned fore-and-aft inside the drop equalizers, give a good balance of [[damping]]. the [[wheelbase]] is {{convert|8|ft|mm|0|abbr=on}}.
